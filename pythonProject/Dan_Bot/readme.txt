DISCORD BOT IDEAS:
##### Make a calculator out of the discord buttons (Button commands)
      Make this calculator edit/update in real time so others see what ur doin

##### Figure out how dropdowns work and do ufnky stuff with em!

##### Funny image editor/edits (Using pillow rn)
##### Make it so that when u press a button, it scrolls between the image edits
##### Make it so that when u press a button, it changes what time the bot it gives you (Year, month, day)
##### Make it so you press a button, and it gives you permissions to use a certian command (Prob epic command)
##### Make it so when u press button it gets disables
##### Optimise the roll commend (Instead of "(1,2,3,4,5,6)", Make it custumisable. (Maybe with the option thing, black prompt thing, y know what im talkin about)
##### Fake Econemy or stock looker
#####

##### Make wordle, or tetris

###### Make cool web game, black background
###### white graphics only, with some cool exeptions. When something goes to edge of screen, it immediately (smoothly) teleports to opposite edge
###### Not really a game, but a thing to play around in i guess
