To get to the Python Files with dan bot and stuff:
click on "file" on the top left, then open, then go to Users > Weird > Pycharm Projects
Make sure the interpreter is right (File > Settings > Project:xxxx > Interpreter) - am using 3.10.5 (2)


Type in "python" in the terminal 2 make sure Ive got the right one (I need python 3.10.5, from Jun 6 2022)
Quit with "quit()" to get out of that


TERMINAL:
Put that in to direct to it:
cd 'C:\Users\Weird\PycharmProjects\Website Environment\Epic Website\mysite\'

Make work if possible (rename it)
 - (cd 'C:\Users\Weird\PycharmProjects\Website Environment\Epic_Website\') - Renaming things dont seem 2 work?

To turn on the server:
py manage.py runserver

test
